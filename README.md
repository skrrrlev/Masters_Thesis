# Master Thesis Git Repository
This repository contains all the code I write and data used/produced for my Master's thesis.

## Setup
If you plan to clone this directory and work with it, please look at the [documentation](Docs/SETUP.md) I've created for this purpose. Also, if you plan to use some of the scripts, you might need to look at the _Master Thesis Library_ (MTLib), in which I've added a lot of methods and classes for readability of the scripts.
